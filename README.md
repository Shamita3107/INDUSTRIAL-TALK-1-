# Industrial Talk 1✨ — PPG Digital IT Insight

**Date:** 19 November 2025

I attended an industrial talk titled **PPG Digital IT Insight**, where speakers described how PPG Digital applies data analytics, MLOps, and Master Data practices for industrial applications. The session was insightful and helped me better understand industry workflows and career opportunities in IT.

## Summary
The talk covered:
- How PPG Digital uses data analytics and Master Data for industrial use cases
- The role of MLOps in putting machine learning into production reliably
- Real-world examples showing how analytics drives decision-making in industrial contexts

## Key takeaways
- MLOps and Master Data are essential for production-ready analytics — not just models but pipelines, monitoring, and governance.
- Industrial applications need robust data hygiene and lifecycle management to scale analytics safely.
- Soft skills such as adaptability, continuous learning, and collaboration are valued alongside technical ability.
- The talk highlighted clear career pathways for IT students who want to work in analytics/industry.

## How it helped me
The session pushed me to think more seriously about:
- Building stronger technical foundations (data engineering, MLOps basics)
- Investing in self-development (courses, small projects, internships)
- Networking with industry to find mentorship and project opportunities

## Suggested next steps
- Explore an introductory MLOps tutorial or course (CI/CD for ML, model monitoring).
- Start a small project that demonstrates a simple data pipeline + model + basic monitoring.
- Follow up with PPG Digital contacts or materials shared at the talk.
- Add learning milestones to your GitHub (e.g., "MLOps demo", "Master Data checklist").
